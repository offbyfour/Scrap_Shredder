# Hardware Architecture


### Blades

The blades are made out of steel and have an odd number of teeth in order to limit the number of teeth cutting material at the same time.

### Spacers

Spacers can be made of of aluminum as they are not meant to do any work. Their main job is to space out the blades.

### Wipers

After shearing, debris can sometimes get stuck around the blades/spacers. The wipers are used to help push this debris towards the outlet. Like the spacers they are not expected to help with the actual cutting so they can be made of aluminum

### Axles

The axles are how the motors transfer torque to the blades, Therefore they are made of two inch steel hexbar This design consists of two axles, both spinning towards the center of the device. Each axle is driven directly by a motor so no axle to axle gearing is necessary.

### Motors

The motors used for this design are repourposed 12V/1HP winch motors. They can be found readily online and include a planetary gearbox to step down the RPM and up the torque to acceptable ranges for a shredder.

### Motor Couplers

Motor couplers are used to join the motors to the axle. They ride on bearings mounted to the housing. Ideally they would be made of steel. But due to the custom construction, they will be made of aluminum.

### Housing

Other than the front and rear faceplates, the housing is under very little stress. Made entirely out of aluminum, the front and back faceplates are made one inch thick to handle the required force.

### Power Supply
The power supply will vary based on motor configuration. At the moment only 2HP-120V is being designed. 

#### 2HP-120V

The plan for this configuration is have one constant current supply (12V/50A) power each motor. These supplies will also be OR'd with a car battery. The purpose of the battery is to provide burst current to the motors when cutting something tough.
