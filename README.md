# Configuratiions
There are 2 possible power configurations using the available mounts, 2HP and 4HP. 

## 2HP-120V Config
This config uses two 1HP motors and is intended to be used on standard 120V@15A USA outlets. Please note that this system wIll pull close to the rated power of the outlet so no other appliances should be on the circuit.

## 4HP-240V Config
This config uses four 1HP motors and is intended to be used on standard 240V@30A USA outlets.

## Other 240V or 3-Phase configs
Stronger more expensive motors are available that could take advantage of higher outlet power but they were not explored due to cost. If you do decide to build one, Id love to hear about how it went!
